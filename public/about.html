<p>Showcasing who you are to others is one of the most important aspects of being successful. For some of us it requires a well-made website that portrays your culture, emphasizes strengths and provides transparency. A Website is often the one and only indicator of whether someone is willing to get to know you better and try what you have to offer.</p>

<p>For years, I have created financial models forecasting cost, revenue, expenses. I have automated financial reporting creating value for customers to view a snapshot of where we are. </p>

<p>I am a Web Developer working to add value to businesses and individuals looking to show off what they do best. I am happy to help.</p>
